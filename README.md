# Pi Calculator
A modern React application that calculates œÄ (pi) using various mathematical methods, all wrapped in an engaging Matrix-inspired interface.

## üî¢ Features

- **Multiple Calculation Methods**: Choose from 10 different mathematical approaches to calculate œÄ:
  - Leibniz Series
  - Monte Carlo Simulation
  - Nilakantha Series
  - Arctan Method
  - Chudnovsky Series
  - Euler's Method
  - Wallis Product
  - Viete's Formula
  - BBP Formula
  - Ramanujan Series

- **Visual Feedback**: See the calculated value, error margin, and comparison to the actual value of œÄ

## üßÆ How It Works

The Pi Calculator uses various mathematical formulas and algorithms to compute the value of œÄ to varying degrees of precision. The calculation methods range from simple series (like Leibniz) to more complex approaches (like Chudnovsky).

Each method converges to œÄ at different rates:
- Some methods (like Monte Carlo) are intuitive but converge slowly
- Others (like Chudnovsky) are more complex but converge rapidly

The application lets you specify how many iterations or points to use in the calculation, allowing you to experiment with the trade-off between computation time and precision.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- React.js
- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5 Canvas (for the Matrix effect)
- CSS3 with modern features

## ‚öôÔ∏è Customizing the Matrix Effect

The Matrix rain effect can be customized by modifying the `MatrixRain` component in `App.js`:

- **Speed**: Adjust the `frameDelay` variable (higher values = slower animation)
- **Density**: Modify the `fontSize` and `increment` values
- **Fall Rate**: Change the speed by modifying the drops increment value
- **Colors**: Update the `ctx.fillStyle` to change the character color
